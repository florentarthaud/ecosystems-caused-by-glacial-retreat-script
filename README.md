01_aggregatedRGI20_script and 02_averagedRGI20_script and 03_R_overdeepenings_volume_RGI20 were used to calculate paramaters for all glaciers (called RGI20)

04_R_Deglaciated Area by year was used to calculate dynamic of deglaciated area for each glacier (from RGI01 to RGI19) and all glaciers (called RGI20)

05_realize_fig_png was used to realise every figures and summary tables
